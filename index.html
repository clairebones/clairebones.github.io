                <p>In my current position I primarily work on large Angular builds or single page apps built with HTML5, SCSS and a range of frameworks depending on the project. I have a particular interest in accessibility and attempt to implement accessibility standards in any builds I can along with sharing these requirements with the rest of the dev and design team. I also enjoy attending the fortnightly night classes and regular lightning talks.</p>

                <p>Outside of work I enjoy running local events such as Girl Geeks Belfast and Global Game Jam, being involved with Farset Labs as the community manager, and attending various meetups.  I have also given talks at various events about my role in tech and my experiences as a woman in tech.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I enjoy gaming and reading, and am currently learning to drive.</p>

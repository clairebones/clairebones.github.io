                <p>I’m Claire, a tech nerd with a particular interest in front-end/web development who enjoys being part of the tech community in Belfast.</p>

                <p>In my current position I primarily work on large Angular builds or single page apps built with HTML5, SCSS and a range of frameworks depending on the project. I have a particular interest in accessibility and attempt to implement accessibility standards in any builds I can along with sharing these requirements with the rest of the dev and design team. I also enjoy attending the fortnightly night classes and regular lightning talks, and gave a talk on accessibility in design and development to the rest of the Belfast team.</p>

                <p>Outside of work I enjoy running local events such as Girl Geeks Belfast and Global Game Jam, being involved with Farset Labs as the community manager, and attending various meetups.  I have also given talks at various events about my role in tech and my experiences as a woman in tech.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I enjoy gaming and reading, and am currently learning to drive. I also like to spend time on my nails and nail art, and on photography, including volunteer photography at QCon for the past 5 years.</p>
